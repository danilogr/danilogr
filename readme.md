          I'm a researcher-turned-founder exploring how AI can meaningfully augment human capability in the physical world.
          While most AI is optimized for text, code, and screens, I'm focused on what becomes possible when AI can perceive
          real environments, understand ongoing tasks, and guide people through complex physical work in real time.

            My work sits at the intersection of AR/VR, human-computer interaction, medical imaging, and multimodal AI.
            I'm driven by the challenge of translating abstract intelligence into concrete action - building systems that
            are trusted, intuitive, and effective under real-world constraints.

            I'm currently a <strong>Founder Fellow</strong> at <strong>South Park Commons</strong>, exploring and developing ideas
            around AI-powered systems for physical labor and skilled work.
