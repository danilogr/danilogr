<h3>Hello! I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate at UC San Diego ( <a href="https://ubicomp.ucsd.edu">Weibel Lab</a>) / <a href="https://designlab.ucsd.edu">Design Lab</a>)
</h3>
Main main research focus is on improving remote and co-located surgical mentoring and training through eXtended Reality technology.

In my research, I use *mixed methods* to better understand *user goals*, *co-design* with stakeholders, and *evaluate* and *explain* interventions.
I also *develop* prototypes, tools, and systems. For example, tools to facilitate the rapid-prototyping of Augmented Reality applications.

> **As of 2020, I am excited to share that my research is supported by an [Intuitive Surgical](https://intuitive.com) Ph.D. Research Fellowship.**
